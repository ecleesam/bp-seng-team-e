Jumanji Adventure

This project is a short story game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The player makes choices that change how the story goes. Each choice affects the score and can lead to winning or losing the game.

How It Works
index.html

This is the main web page for the game.

It shows the title, story text, choice buttons, score, and restart button.

It also has a canvas to display background images for each scene.

The file connects to style.css and script.js.

style.css

Adds the jungle-style background and text colors.

Styles the container box, buttons, and story area.

The page is centered and looks like an adventure setting.

Buttons are green and change color when hovered over.

script.js

Controls how the game runs.

Stores all story scenes, images, and choices.

Updates the story, image, and score each time a choice is clicked.

When the player reaches the end, a “Restart” button appears to play again.

Uses the Canvas API to show images for each part of the story.

test.js

A small script to check that the story data works correctly.

It tests if key scenes exist and shows “Jumanji basic tests passed!” in the console if everything is fine.
